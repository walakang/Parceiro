Ok.... I HAD A DREAM.   
...and now, i have WORK TO DO TO MAKE IT HAPPEN

I wanted my own taste of personal organizer an dproductivity app. 
But it had to fullfill some reqisites

_HAVE TO_...:
--- NO DEPENDENCY ON ANY LIBRARY OR FRAMEWORK. Non negociable
--- Single page, monolithic. all the needed stuff in just only ONE file.
--- Independent on the storage side, so as to make it urniversal and portable, able to run on no mattehr what browser or platform.
--- (that means: able to export/import it's data from files on disk/pendrive/or whatever future media available)
--- (as a plus, this meant shareable also, as two people working on the same context, would be able to exchange contents easyly)
--- Versatile enough to handle different projects and able to filter data acording to some miniman criteria
--- Minimal recourses to preserve some privacy and datasecurity

_Nice to have_...:
customization (you know, some custom background and stuff..)
Interaction with other tools
some look i had been fond of...

(i read your mind,,, you there thinking... 'Sort of a Trello clone, uh??' but i wont fail easy on the bait... 
  I like the digital kanban paradigma to deal with tasks and reorganize items,, given,,, 
   but it was not and it's not my goal just replicate some interface, no natter how approved and popular it could have turned. 

On the other side, dont mind to adopt some of its practical good aspects either)

on the end, after wandering and admiring tons of excelent work i am not yet able to replicate or sometimes understand, i set my proyect architecture:
- Login and user management
- Proyect management
  * Boards and tasks management
- Productivity
  * Event Calendar
  * Pomodoro timer
- To wrap it all, a simple DashBoard (heck,  after all, i wanted to learn a couple of things not just stitch code together)

So here am I.  George W Park did a very appealing work on creating a front screen, that i loved at first sight. Took it from Codepen
ZackThouth  and Shidil Eringa had assembled a kanban logic with a nice engine, realy on line with my requirements (specially Shidil, beceuase pure javascript, no frameworks). Took their work as exposed on GithHub, with permission
other places (some cant clearly remember....) but GeekForGeeks, and StackOverflow,CodingNepal, Medium and  a few more places (Google search results, anyway) sure added their inspiring and allways helpimng hand on the form of snippets orfull examples tha t now, is my turn to sew together and make it finally happen.

So, if i ripe, its because they were there before. repeatinng the old saying "if I've seen further, it was because i was standing on the shoulder of giants". Thanks you all.

Praise to them on the good points, blame and shame on me on the flaws and mistakes, but  heck... tried my best. Upbuilding criticism and sugestions ways very welcome, even when i cant commit to follow all of it. Blame it on my ignorance and arrogance...but this is a project to satisfy , first, my personal needs, so, like my tie and my shoes may not be what every one out there will like to wear around.

thanks for bearing me up to here. Now, To work!
